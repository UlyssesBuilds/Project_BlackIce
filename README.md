# Project_BlackIce
Web App to learn: Cloud, API, Security 

Current Status: We have established a robust foundational web project on GitHub, leveraging Flask to create a scalable API-driven web application with a modular structure and automated development environment. This MVP includes essential security measures and is set up for future enhancements like ML-based anomaly detection and Zero Trust architecture integration.

## Overview  
Project BlackIce is a cloud-based web server designed to integrate modern security principles (Zero Trust, API-based firewalls) and AI-driven monitoring to analyze network traffic. The goal is to create a scalable and secure infrastructure while learning key cloud, security, and backend development concepts.

## 🔍 Objectives
- ✅ Build a basic **web server** with API endpoints (Flask/Express.js)
- ✅ Implement **secure authentication** (JWT / token-based access)
- ✅ Set up **firewall rules** using a Zero Trust model
- 🚧 Integrate **ML models** for detecting unusual traffic patterns
- 🚧 Develop a **basic SIEM** to log and analyze traffic

## 📅 Project Phases & Progress
### **Phase 1: Core Web Server & API Development**
- [x] Set up GitHub repo & project structure ✅
- [ ] Implement a basic API server ✅
- [ ] Add HTTPS support for secure connections (next step)  

### **Phase 2: Security & Access Control**
- [ ] Implement authentication (JWT, OAuth, or API keys)
- [ ] Define firewall rules (Zero Trust security)
- [ ] Test with simulated attack scenarios  

### **Phase 3: AI/ML-Based Threat Detection**
- [ ] Collect and analyze network traffic
- [ ] Train an anomaly detection model
- [ ] Implement real-time alerting system  


## 🏗️ Tech Stack  
- **Backend:** Flask (Python) / Express.js (Node.js)  
- **Security:** JWT Auth, Zero Trust Model  
- **Monitoring:** ELK Stack, Prometheus, Grafana  
- **ML:** TensorFlow / Scikit-Learn (Anomaly Detection)  
- **Cloud Deployment:** AWS / Azure / GCP (TBD)
